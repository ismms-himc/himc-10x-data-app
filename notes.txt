Notes for own educational purposes only.

When setting up:
1.) Integrate with admin-on-rest:
cd app/api
sudo npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
yarn add admin-on-rest
sudo npm install
sudo yarn start OR sudo npm start
Note to self: pack.json name: frontend. May need to change later on
